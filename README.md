This GitHub repository contains a set of SQL queries designed to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data. The queries are written for Microsoft SQL Server and are aimed at extracting insights from the PortfolioProject database, focusing on the covid_deaths and covid_vaccination datasets.

The queries cover various aspects of COVID-19 statistics, including global numbers, continent-level statistics, country-level statistics, death rates, average daily deaths, vaccination data, and more. They utilize SQL features such as aggregation functions, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and temporary tables to perform data manipulation and calculations.

Additionally, the repository includes a view named populationVSvaccination to store data for visualization purposes. This view aggregates COVID-19 death and vaccination data at the country level and calculates rolling vaccination counts and vaccination percentages over time.

These SQL queries can be used to gain insights into the spread of COVID-19, track vaccination progress, and inform decision-making processes aimed at combating the pandemic.
